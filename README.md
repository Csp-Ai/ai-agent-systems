## 👣 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Csp-Ai/ai-agent-systems.git

# Navigate into project
cd ai-agent-systems

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm start

## 🌐 Localization & Submission Pipeline

The backend includes optional translation utilities powered by **LibreTranslate**. Pass a `locale` when calling `/run-agent` to automatically translate an agent's output. The API also exposes `/translate`, `/detect-language`, and `/locales` helpers for ad-hoc requests.

Developers can submit new agents through `/submit-agent` with metadata and a zip file. Submissions are staged for manual review before integration.
